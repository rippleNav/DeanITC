            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2, 2026</p>

            <p>
                Welcome to <span class="highlight">DeanITC</span>, hosted at
                <a href="https://i-awesome.me/DeanITC/"
                    >https://i-awesome.me/DeanITC/</a
                >. By accessing or using this application, you agree to be bound
                by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not
                use the service.
            </p>

            <!-- Section 1 -->
            <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
                DeanITC is a development project and toolset provided "as-is."
                The application may offer optional Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                features. These features are provided as an enhancement and are
                not a core requirement for the use of the basic application.
            </p>

            <!-- Section 2 -->
            <h2>2. AI Features and Third-Party Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>
                By opting into the AI-powered features of DeanITC, you
                acknowledge the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Accuracy:</strong> AI-generated content may be
                    inaccurate, incomplete, or biased. You are responsible for
                    verifying any output generated by the AI.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Third-Party Providers:</strong> The AI features rely
                    on external APIs (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google).
                    Your use of these features is subject to the availability
                    and terms of these third-party providers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Experimental Nature:</strong> AI features are
                    provided on an "experimental" basis and may be modified or
                    removed at any time without prior notice.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Section 3 -->
            <h2>3. Service Availability and Network Issues</h2>
            <p>
                We strive for high uptime, but we do not guarantee that the
                service will be available 100% of the time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Planned & Unplanned Downtime:</strong> The service
                    may be unavailable due to maintenance, server updates, or
                    issues with the underlying network infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>API Outages:</strong> Because DeanITC relies on
                    third-party APIs for its AI features, outages from those
                    providers may cause specific features to become unavailable.
                    This is beyond our control.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Section 4 -->
            <h2>4. No Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
                DeanITC operates on a "no refund" basis for any paid tiers or
                credits (if applicable).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Downtime is Not a Basis for Refund:</strong>
                    Temporary unavailability of the service, network outages, or
                    third-party API failures do not constitute grounds for a
                    refund.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Service as Provided:</strong> By using the service,
                    you accept that technical interruptions are a part of
                    web-based software and agree that no compensation or refund
                    will be issued for periods of downtime.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Section 5 -->
            <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ownership:</strong> The code, design, and branding
                    of DeanITC are the property of the developer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Content:</strong> You retain ownership of any
                    data you input into the app, but you grant DeanITC the
                    necessary licenses to process that data (including sending
                    it to AI APIs) to provide the service to you.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Section 6 -->
            <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
